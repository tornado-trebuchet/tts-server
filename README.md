# tts-server
Text to speech local server

# Plan 
1) Generic port for all adapters Coqui as first main adapter
2) Domain defines generalized adapter input - output types 
3) Persistence layer for voice models. byte blobs? storage in .cache? DB for models?  
4) Voice cloning service -> separate port and adapter
